# Seller Checklist — Internal Use Only

> Do **not** include this file when distributing the repo to buyers.
> Delete it from any fork you hand off, or keep buyers on a private
> repo where they only see the necessary files.

## One-time setup (do this once, before your first sale)

- [ ] Open `LICENSE` and replace:
  - [ ] `[Your Name / Company]` with your legal copyright holder name
  - [ ] `[Your Jurisdiction]` with your governing jurisdiction (e.g. "the State of California, USA")
- [ ] Update `README.md` contact / support email if you want a public-facing one.
- [ ] Push the repo to GitHub as a **private** repository (settings → Visibility → Private).
- [ ] Optionally mark it as a **template repository** so each buyer fork is independent.
- [ ] Build your one-click Deploy-to-Vercel URL:

      https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYOUR_ORG%2FYOUR_REPO&env=VITE_SUPABASE_URL,VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY&envDescription=Get%20these%20from%20Supabase%20Project%20Settings%20%E2%86%92%20API

- [ ] Do a full **dry-run deployment** yourself using throwaway Supabase + Vercel accounts:
  - [ ] `setup.sql` runs clean with `Setup complete`
  - [ ] App loads on the Vercel URL
  - [ ] Sign up + log in works
  - [ ] Create a library item
  - [ ] Generate a report (PDF download works)
  - [ ] Share a report (shared link loads in a fresh browser)

## Build the buyer ZIP (one command)

Bundle all six handoff files into a single download:

```
npm install        # one time
npm run handoff
```

Output: `dist-handoff/myrof-report-handoff.zip` — attach this single
file to the buyer handoff email. It contains:
`LICENSE`, `setup.sql`, `.env.example`, `BUYER_SETUP.md`,
`SELLER_CHECKLIST.md`, `README.md`.

Remember to remove `SELLER_CHECKLIST.md` from the ZIP before sending if
you don't want the buyer to see it (edit the `FILES` array in
`scripts/build-handoff-zip.mjs`).

## Per-sale checklist

- [ ] Payment received and recorded.
- [ ] Collect from the buyer:
  - [ ] Buyer's full legal business entity name (for license record)
  - [ ] Buyer's GitHub username (if granting repo access directly)
  - [ ] Primary contact email
- [ ] Grant repository access:
  - **Option A (recommended):** Add buyer as a collaborator on a fresh private fork dedicated to that buyer.
  - **Option B:** Send them a zip / archive of the source.
- [ ] Send the buyer:
  - [ ] Link to `BUYER_SETUP.md`
  - [ ] Your custom Deploy-to-Vercel URL
  - [ ] Their license record (entity name + sale date)
- [ ] Log the sale in your records: entity name, sale date, GitHub access granted, version sold.

---

## When ending a license

- [ ] Revoke GitHub collaborator access.
- [ ] Notify buyer in writing that the license has terminated and they must destroy all copies (per LICENSE §6).
